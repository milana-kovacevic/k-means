# k-means

##About
This is an implementation of the k-means algorithm for processing images.

##Usage
Open a picture you want by File > Open or by drag 'n drop method. Using sliders choose k and the precision. K is a number of colors you want in your output image. Precision is a number of iterations that will be done during the process. Bigger precision results a nicer output but at the same time prolongs the execution time of the program (6-7 iterations is OK).

The result is your picture, but changed to have only k colors. Save your picture by File > Save as...

Enjoy my little project! And please report all the bugs :)
